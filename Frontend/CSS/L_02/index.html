            <p>Everyone knows that paper is made from trees. But when one looks at trees, one cannot imagine that something so soft and fragile as 
                the paper is made is so hard and strong. Plant materials such as wood are made of fibres known as cellulose. It is the primary ingredient in paper making. 
                Raw wood is first converted into pulp consisting of a mixture of Cellulose, lignin, water and some chemicals. The pulp can be made mechanically through grinders
                or through chemical processes. Short fibres are produced by mechanical grinding. The paper produced in this way is weak and is used to make newspapers, magazines and phonebooks.

                Rainy season
                After summer comes the rainy season. It lasts from mid-June to the end of <span class="highlight">September</span>. During this time of year, the sky is cloudy. It drizzles and rains cats and dogs sometimes. Rains provide relief from the oppressive summer heat. Green leaves are developed by the tree. Ponds and rivers are full of water. Monsoon is a boon for farmers.
                Rainwater softens the soil and makes it suitable for cultivation. Monsoon has some disadvantages. Due to heavy and incessant rainfall, the roads, especially in villages, become muddy.
