intro : this code is a unit test for the Repository class. It uses Moq to create mock objects for ApplicationDbContext and DbSet<SampleEntity>.
The test method CreateAsync_AddEntity_To_DBSet verifies that when the CreateAsync method of the repository is called with a SampleEntity object,
it adds the entity to the DbSet using the AddAsync method.

//dbSetMock.Verify(x => x.AddAsync(entity, default), Times.Once);
this line of code verifies that during the test execution, the AddAsync method of the mocked DbSet (dbSetMock) is called exactly once with the provided
entity (entity) and default cancellation token (default). If it is not called exactly once, the test will fail. This ensures that the CreateAsync
method of the repository correctly adds the entity to the DbSet.


GetAllAsync_Returnsall()
this test method sets up a mock DbSet containing a list of sample entities with predefined IDs. It then calls the GetAllAsync method of
the repository with a predicate (entity => entity.Id > 0) to retrieve all entities where the ID is greater than 0. Finally,
it asserts that the result obtained from GetAllAsync matches the expected list of entities. This ensures that the repository
correctly retrieves all entities that meet the specified criteria.
