Prototype Design Pattern
The Prototype design pattern is part of the Creational Patterns family. It allows creating new 
objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype, rather than creating objects from 
scratch. This pattern is particularly useful when object creation is resource-intensive
(e.g., involves a lot of computation, network requests, or database queries).

Key Concepts
Prototype: An existing object that serves as a template.
Clone: A method that creates a copy of the prototype object.
The Prototype pattern can be implemented using shallow or deep copying, depending on whether the 
cloned object needs to copy references (shallow copy) or clone all nested objects (deep copy).

Real-World Example
Imagine you're developing a game where each character has numerous attributes (name, skills, weapons, abilities, etc.).
If creating a character from scratch involves a lot of configuration, it might be easier to create one base character 
(a prototype) and clone it for new characters, modifying only specific attributes like the name or weapon.
