Composite Design Pattern Overview
The Composite design pattern is a structural design pattern used to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It allows you to create tree-like structures where nodes can be either individual objects or collections of objects. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to represent part-whole hierarchies, such as files in a directory structure or UI components in a GUI.

Key Components of Composite Pattern
Component: An abstract base class or interface that defines common operations for both simple and composite objects.
Leaf: A class representing individual objects in the structure. It implements the Component interface.
Composite: A class that contains a group of Leaf or Composite objects. It also implements the Component interface.
Client: The code that uses the Component interface to interact with both individual and composite objects.
Real-World Examples
File System: Files and folders. A folder may contain other folders and files.
UI Components: Buttons, panels, and windows. A window contains other UI elements, like buttons, panels, and text fields.
Graphics Editor: Shapes like circles or rectangles can be individual objects (leaf), while a group of shapes can form a composite object.
Use Cases of Composite Design Pattern
Tree structures: When working with recursive structures such as directories, hierarchical menus, or organization charts.
Uniform treatment of individual and composite objects: When you want the client to handle individual elements and their groups in the same way.
Graphics or UI components: In rendering engines or user interface libraries.
Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages
Simplicity for clients: Clients can interact with objects and compositions uniformly.
Extensibility: Adding new types of objects (Leaf or Composite) is easy.
Recursive structure: Composite naturally supports hierarchical structures.
Code reusability: Reduces code duplication by using the same interface for both individual and composite objects.
Disadvantages
Complexity: Can make the design more complex than necessary if the structure is simple.
Performance: Accessing a deep object structure may impact performance if the hierarchy is large.
Difficult to restrict access: Clients can manipulate the structure freely, which might lead to unintended consequences.

C# Implementation of Composite Design Pattern
Below is a well-documented, complete C# implementation of the Composite Design Pattern, demonstrating how a file system hierarchy (with files and folders) can be implemented.

        Folder folder2 = new Folder("Folder2");

        Folder root = new Folder("Root");
        root.Add(folder1);

Explanation of the Code
IFileSystemItem: This is the Component interface, defining a Display method to be implemented by both File and Folder.
File: This is the Leaf class, representing individual files. It implements IFileSystemItem and displays its name.
Folder: This is the Composite class, which can contain both files and other folders. It implements IFileSystemItem and manages a list of child items.
Program: The Client code creates a hierarchy of files and folders, and then displays the entire structure.

Discussion
When to Use the Composite Pattern
Use when dealing with hierarchical structures such as trees or organization charts.
When you want clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
When objects need to be composed recursively, and you want to avoid complex code for handling different object types.
Advantages of This Example
Scalability: You can easily add more files or folders.
Uniformity: The client treats individual files and folders uniformly through the IFileSystemItem interface.
Extensibility: Adding new file types or folder operations is easy without changing the existing code.
Disadvantages
Memory overhead: Each object in the hierarchy carries some overhead, especially for large structures.
Complexity: In small applications, this pattern might introduce unnecessary complexity.
