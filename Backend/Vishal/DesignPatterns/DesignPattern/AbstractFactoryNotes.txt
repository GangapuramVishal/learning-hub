Abstract Factory Design Pattern Overview
The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows the creation of objects that share a common theme but may have different implementations.

Key Components
Abstract Factory: Declares methods for creating abstract products.
Concrete Factory: Implements the abstract factory methods to produce concrete products.
Abstract Product: Declares the interface for a type of product.
Concrete Product: Implements the abstract product interface.
Client: Uses the abstract factory and abstract products, often unaware of the specific concrete implementations.


Example: Furniture Factory
Problem Domain
We want to create furniture for different styles, each having a set of related products: Chair and Table. Each style has its own design for these products.

Components
Abstract Product: Chair and Table interfaces.
Concrete Product: Victorian and Modern implementations of Chair and Table.
Abstract Factory: FurnitureFactory interface to create the abstract products.
Concrete Factory: VictorianFactory and ModernFactory to create concrete products.
