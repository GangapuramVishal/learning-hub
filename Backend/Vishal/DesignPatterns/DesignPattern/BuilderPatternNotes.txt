Builder Design Pattern - Detailed Explanation
The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that is used to construct a complex object step by step. 
Unlike other creational patterns (such as Factory or Abstract Factory), the Builder pattern separates the construction of an object from its representation,
allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

This pattern is particularly useful when:

An object has many optional or required parameters.
The construction of an object is complex and involves multiple steps.
Key Components of the Builder Pattern:
Builder: An interface or abstract class that defines the methods for constructing the parts of the product.
ConcreteBuilder: Implements the Builder interface and provides the actual functionality for creating parts of the product.
Product: The final object that is being constructed.
Director: (Optional) Responsible for managing the construction process using the builder.

Real-world Example:
A good analogy for the Builder pattern is assembling a car. Different cars have similar components (e.g., engine, wheels, body),
but they vary in terms of model, engine type, and interior features. The Builder pattern allows us to specify these details step
by step, eventually producing a different kind of car (SUV, sedan, or truck).


Explanation of the Code:
Car: The Product class that represents the complex object we are constructing.
CarBuilder: The Builder abstract class that declares the methods for creating parts of the car.
SUVCarBuilder: A ConcreteBuilder that provides the actual implementations for building an SUV car.
CarDirector: The Director class that manages the construction process by calling the appropriate steps on the builder.
Program: The Main method demonstrates how to use the Builder pattern to construct an SUV with various features.

Use Cases of the Builder Pattern:
When to use:
If an object has many parts that need to be built independently.
When the construction process is complex and needs to be controlled.
If you need to ensure that an object is constructed in a consistent, step-by-step manner.
