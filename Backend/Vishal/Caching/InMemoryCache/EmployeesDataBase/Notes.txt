IMemoryCache and ICacheProvider serve similar purposes in abstracting caching functionality, but they differ in their scope and usage:

IMemoryCache:
IMemoryCache is a built-in interface provided by ASP.NET Core for working specifically with an in-memory cache.
It is part of the Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory namespace.
It provides methods to interact with an in-memory cache, such as adding, retrieving, and removing items from the cache.
IMemoryCache is tightly coupled with the in-memory caching mechanism provided by ASP.NET Core and is optimized for use with in-memory caching scenarios.
It is typically used directly in ASP.NET Core applications when working with in-memory caching.
ICacheProvider:
ICacheProvider is a custom interface defined by your application or framework to abstract caching functionality in a generic way.
It is not specific to any particular caching implementation and can be used to work with various caching mechanisms.
ICacheProvider defines a set of methods that any cache provider must implement, such as TryGetValue, Set, etc.
It provides a level of abstraction that allows you to swap different caching implementations (e.g., in-memory cache, distributed cache) without changing the consuming code.
ICacheProvider is often used in scenarios where you want to decouple the application from the specific caching implementation and provide flexibility in choosing and changing caching strategies.
In summary, IMemoryCache is a specific interface for working with in-memory caching provided by ASP.NET Core, 
while ICacheProvider is a custom interface that abstracts caching functionality in a generic way, allowing 
for flexibility in choosing and swapping caching implementations. Depending on your application's requirements,
you may use one or both of these interfaces.
