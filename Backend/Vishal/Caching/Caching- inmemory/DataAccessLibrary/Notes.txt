What is Caching?
Caching is a method that stores the page output or application data between HTTP requests in memory so that
future requests for the same piece of data or page are obtained from memory. It enhances application speed
by allowing for quicker page rendering and fewer server resources. .NET developers can use caching to create
scalable, high-performance apps.

In-memory caching is a common technique used to improve the performance of web applications. It involves storing frequently
accessed data in memory so that it can be quickly retrieved without having to query a data store or perform expensive computations.

A cache is a location usually present in the memory that facilitates high-speed data access. Caches store this
subset of data to provide quick access to it and avoid accessing slower data stores for the same piece of data.

What is In-Memory Caching?
You can also take advantage of in-memory caching to improve the performance and scalability of an application.
To leverage in-memory caching in ASP.NET 6, you should take advantage of the IMemoryCache interface.
The IMemoryCache interface looks like this:

public interface IMemoryCache : IDisposable
{
    bool TryGetValue(object key, out object value);
    ICacheEntry CreateEntry(object key);
    void Remove(object key);
}

You can add in-memory cache services to the request processing pipeline using the following code snippet in the Program.cs file in ASP.NET:

services.AddMemoryCache();

Once you have registered in-memory caching services with the built-in IoC container, you can use in-memory
caching in your controllers as shown in the code snippet given below:

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
  private IMemoryCache cache;
  public MyController(IMemoryCache cache)
  {
     this.cache = cache;
  }
}


What is Distributed Caching?
Distributed caching is a common way to cache data in a large, cloud-based application. It is useful when you need fast access
to your data, but the volume of that data prevents it from being stored on one server.

This type of caching stores duplicates of your data across multiple servers—that is, it creates replicas of your data across
multiple servers. The replicas are stored in memory on each server (rather than being persisted to disk), which means they
can be lost if the server crashes or restarts.

A distributed cache increases performance because it reduces the number of requests sent over the network.

In-Memory Cache: In-memory caching stores data directly within the application's memory space.
It typically uses data structures like dictionaries or specialized caching libraries such as MemoryCache 
in .NET. The cached data resides within the application process.

Redis Cache: Redis is a standalone, in-memory data structure store that operates as a separate server.
Applications interact with Redis over the network using client libraries. Cached data is stored in the Redis
server's memory, which is independent of the application process.
